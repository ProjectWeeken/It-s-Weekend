Ask Their Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Score</h3><figure class="at"><div class="au" style="padding-top:56.1798%"><div class="lU"><noscript><video autoPlay playsInline muted loop><source src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/12/9e7504c2-8dbb-49c2-bf1d-dd64a6c0e7e3-200.gif?fm=mp4" /></video></noscript></div></div><cite class="ao"><a href="//giphy.com/gifs/3o7TKJbg9tcu3OkF7a">Giphy</a></cite></figure><p>&quot;As an introvert, my absolute favorite thing is to ask people what their <a class="al" href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/the-16-mbti-types.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MBTI score</a> is or give them the quiz myself,&quot; <a class="al" href="http://joinblush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">life coach</a> Kali Rogers tells Bustle. &quot;It forces people to talk about themselves and you learn about the other person.&quot; And talking about someone's personality type will give you something to work with. &quot;People have a much better shot at liking you if you ask them questions about <i>them</i>.&quot; Truth!</p><h3>2. Ask Follow-Up Questions</h3><figure class="at"><div class="au" style="padding-top:62.5%"><div class="lU"><noscript><video autoPlay playsInline muted loop><source src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/12/7d91c93c-7175-4587-b240-d7ad2b4ff251-giphy.gif?fm=mp4" /></video></noscript></div></div><cite class="ao"><a href="//giphy.com/gifs/xTiTns5Ct22lclZui4">Giphy</a></cite></figure><p>&quot;When working with clients who have social anxiety, I always suggest taking a 'curious' perspective and suggest asking people about themselves,&quot; Boston-based <a class="al" href="http://drbobbiwegner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clinical psychologist</a> Bobbi Wegner tells Bustle. &quot;You can start with the basics like 'How do you know the host?' and literally follow the conversation lead with a 'curious' question.&quot; Once they give you something to work with, run with it. If they mention college, ask more — Wegner suggests saying something like &quot;You said from college — how was that college?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Always ask open-ended questions and ask a 'curious' question based on their answer,&quot; she says. &quot;Imagine a question arrow pointing down, and with every question you dig a little deeper.&quot; Just keep going — and the conversation will keep flowing.</p><h3>3. Ask A Genuine Question</h3><figure class="at"><div class="au" style="padding-top:56.1798%"><div class="lU"><noscript><video autoPlay playsInline muted loop><source src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/12/9981e212-5f38-42e4-81a9-cd170ca702c0-200.gif?fm=mp4" /></video></noscript></div></div><cite class="ao"><a href="//giphy.com/gifs/3EagjKK6mAtDq">Giphy</a></cite></figure><p>&quot;The sage advice to open doors by encouraging others to talk about themselves holds true, but the key to its success is for your questions to arise from genuine interest and curiosity,&quot; <a class="al" href="http://www.theanswersunlimited.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal and professional coach</a> Karen Garvey tells Bustle. &quot;A question that genuinely interests you about someone will resonate as being authentic and lend itself to a conversation.&quot; So find something you really want to know about this person you just met, and ask that question.</p><h3>4. Find Out Why They Are There</h3><figure class="at"><div class="au" style="padding-top:65.3595%"><div class="lU"><noscript><video autoPlay playsInline muted loop><source src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/12/314c4d01-473d-4dda-b988-891333956994-200.gif?fm=mp4" /></video></noscript></div></div><cite class="ao"><a href="//giphy.com/gifs/10dmJg2twz6Gl2">Giphy</a></cite></figure><p>&quot;Another strategy is the time-tested advice to find common ground,&quot; Garvey adds. &quot;Finding something in common can be as easy as figuring out how you both came to be at the same event at the same time.&quot; Whatever you ask them about, be sure that you actually want to know the answer. &quot;As your confidence increases, you realize that you have nothing to lose by trying, but a lot to lose by not,&quot; Garvey says. So — at least try!</p><h3>5. Ask How They Know The Host</h3><figure class="at"><div class="au" style="padding-top:41.2%"><div class="lU"><noscript><video autoPlay playsInline muted loop><source src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/12/d9347068-b7f2-42ed-8f04-4fcd2c09c90c-giphy.gif?fm=mp4" /></video></noscript></div></div><cite class="ao"><a href="//giphy.com/gifs/7EErFyyADmj3W">Giphy</a></cite></figure><p>&quot;Ask the other guest how they know the host,&quot; New York–based <a class="al" href="https://askapril.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship expert</a> and author April Masini tells Bustle. &quot;It’s a surefire way to get the conversation started and it’s something the two of you already have in common — you’re both at the party already, so somehow or other, you both know the host.&quot; From there, you can ask more questions about the host and this new person, or perhaps they'll give you new information that you can ask about.</p><p>&quot;Always remember, when meeting someone new, to ask questions,&quot; she says. &quot;It’s a polite and effective way to show interest in the person and the conversation and to learn more about commonalities.&quot; And you'll get to know more about this potential date.</p><h3>6. Try A Random Question</h3><figure class="at"><div class="au" style="padding-top:71.9424%"><div class="lU"><noscript><video autoPlay playsInline muted loop><source src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/12/057a1c61-116b-4425-8483-ec3ce89fb594-200.gif?fm=mp4" /></video></noscript></div></div><cite class="ao"><a href="//giphy.com/gifs/CEtSgDhEDJ9Bu">Giphy</a></cite></figure><p>&quot;You don't want to ask them the common questions that end conversations as quickly as they started,&quot; <a class="al" href="http://www.drnikkimartinez.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychologist Nicole Martinez</a>, who is the author of eight books, including <a class="al" href="https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Relationships-How-Navigate-Them/dp/1530252113/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469649410&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=nicole+martinez" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Reality of Relationships</i> </a>, tells Bustle.&quot;[Asking about] the weather, how they know the host, and have they been here before are all good questions, but lack the creativity that might really get someone's attention, and make them interested and think.&quot; So try something new.</p><p>&quot;For example, I might ask, 'If you found $100 lying on the floor right now, what would be your first thought of what to spend it on?' Out of the ordinary, quirky — but memorable and engaging,&quot; Martinez says. Go in a new direction and see what happens.</p><h3>7.

Ask What They Like On Their Pizza</h3><figure class="at"><div class="au" style="padding-top:56.3126%"><div class="lU"><noscript><video autoPlay playsInline muted loop><source src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/12/e42f6e0b-221c-4574-a342-3913c2365af4-giphy.gif?fm=mp4" /></video></noscript></div></div><cite class="ao"><a href="//giphy.com/gifs/4ugqltNkb9WCY">Giphy</a></cite></figure><p>&quot;I think obscure questions are the best for this situation,&quot; Rob Alex, who created <a class="al" href="http://sexychallenges.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sexy Challenges</a> and <a class="al" href="http://missiondatenight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mission Date Night</a> with his wife, tells Bustle. &quot;My favorite is, 'What toppings do you like on your pizza?'&quot; Random, yes — but fun. &quot;You need easy questions that everyone or anyone can answer,&quot; he adds.</p><p>And by asking about pizza, &quot;you will be rememberable at the event,&quot; he says. &quot;Plus, these questions are not too personal. I don't know anyone that would shy away from telling people what they like on their pizza, or that they have to lie and say they like different things.&quot; LOL — one would hope not! &quot;It just starts the conversations off on an open and honest food.&quot; Nothing wrong with that.</p><h3>9.

Try asking, &quot;What's been keeping you busy these days?&quot; It'll start a longer conversation.</p><p>&quot;You want to utilize open-ended questions which will invite whomever you are speaking with to share more,&quot; she says. &quot;Other questions I recommend: 'How did you get into your line of work?'; 'What was the best part of your day?'; 'What's the best thing you get to do in your job?'; 'What are you looking forward to this week?'; and 'What was the most awkward moment of your day?'&quot; That last one is particularly fun!</p><h3>13. Talk About Something You Noticed</h3><figure class="at"><div class="au" style="padding-top:37.1058%"><div class="lU"><noscript><video autoPlay playsInline muted loop><source src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/12/2aaa230e-93ab-4278-8741-497c44bb4eb9-200.gif?fm=mp4" /></video></noscript></div></div><cite class="ao"><a href="//giphy.com/gifs/l41Yz8L4TIluf39iE">Giphy</a></cite></figure><p>&quot;If you are about to initiate a conversation with someone, then the chances are pretty good that you have been watching them for a bit,&quot; <a class="al" href="http://sugardaddie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dating expert</a> Noah Van Hochman tells Bustle. &quot;In that time, you should have been able to pick up certain things about them.&quot; Smart — use a little psychology to your advantage. Maybe you've noticed &quot;an emblem from a favorite sports team, or piece of jewelry that gives you some insight into something about that person,&quot; he says. &quot;I have even seen a conversation start by discussing a scar on a person’s knee that let the other individual know they had a similar operation.&quot; Whatever you notice, talk about it.</p><p>&quot;These types of icebreakers work very well, but should only be used as follow-ups to the best ice breaker ever invented: Eye contact and a smile,&quot; Van Hochman says. It's true: Eye contact and a smile never hurts.</p><h3>14.
